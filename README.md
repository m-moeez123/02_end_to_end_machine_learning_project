chapter 2 , exercises provided valuable insights into applying and tuning SVM regressors, the benefits of randomized search over grid search for exploring complex hyperparameter spaces, and the nuances of feature selection. While the SVR models on the data subset did not surpass the performance of a Random Forest on the full dataset, the tuning efforts significantly improved the SVR's capabilities. Future work could focus on further optimizing the SVR on the complete dataset (if computational resources allow), tuning the feature selection threshold, and evaluating the impact of the custom feature transformer.
